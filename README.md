# ImageEvolution
Second project using genetic algorithms. The goal is to evolve circles into a predetermined image. 

To start, the program is fed an image that it must replicate. A canvas is then populate randomly by circles of various radius, color, and transparency. Over many generations, the shapes will arrange themselves to closely mimic the predetermined image, creating a unique representation of the image using circles.
